            This document describes an algorithm and a protocol to
            automate DNSSEC multi-signer <xref target="RFC8901" /> setup, operations and decomissioning.
            it makes use of <xref target="RFC8078" /> and <xref target="RFC7477" /> to accomplish this.

            <xref target="RFC8901" /> describes the neccessary steps and API for a multi-signer
            DNSSEC configuration. In this document we will combine <xref target="RFC8901" /> with
            <xref target="RFC8078" /> and <xref target="RFC7477" /> to define a fully

            DNSSEC configuration.

            One of the corner cases of multi-signer DNSSEC is actually the secure change of DNS operator.

                In order for any multi-signer group to give consitent answers over all instances
                the contents of the zone have to be synchronized. The content synchronization is

            <t>
                As described in <xref target="RFC8901" /> a multi-signer DNSSEC configuration
                has some challenges that can be overcome with the right infrastructure and
                following a number of steps for setup and operation.
            </t>
            <t>
                In this document we describe how all of the steps in the multi-signer DNSSEC setup
                can be automated. That is, all except the initial trust between involded signers.

            <name>Secure change of name server operator</name>
            <t>
                Changing the name server operator of a DNSSEC signed zone can be quite a challenge.
                Currently the most used algorithm is "going insecure". This is a bad choice for security.
                And a bad choice for users relying on the security of the zone.
            </t>
            <t>
                Changing name server operators is an edge case of multi-signer DNSSEC operations.
                It simply comes down to the new operator joins the old operator in a multi-signer setup.
                And once that is completed the old operator leaves the multi-signer setup.

            <name>Setting up a new multi-signer group</name>
            <t>
                The zone is already authoritatively served by one DNS operator and is DNSSEC signed.
                For full automation both the KSK and ZSK or CSK must be online.
            </t>
            <t>
                This would be an edge case, a multi-signer group with only one signer.
