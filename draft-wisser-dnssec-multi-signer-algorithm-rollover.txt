1.  Introduction

   [RFC8901] describes the neccessary steps and API for a multi-signer
   DNSSEC configuration.  In this document we will combine [RFC8901]
   with [RFC8078] and [RFC7477] to define a fully automatable algorithm
   for setting up, operating and decomissioning of a multi-signer DNSSEC
   configuration.

   One of the corner cases of multi-signer DNSSEC is actually the secure
   change of DNS operator.

1.1.  Out-Of-Scope

   In order for any multi-signer group to give consitent answers over
   all instances the contents of the zone have to be synchronized.  The
   content synchronization is out-of-scope for this document.

1.2.  Notation

   Short definitions of expressions used in this document

   signer  An entity signing a zone

   multi-signer group  A group of signers that sign the same zone

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Use Cases

2.1.  Running a multi-signer setup

   As described in [RFC8901] a multi-signer DNSSEC configuration has
   some challenges that can be overcome with the right infrastructure
   and following a number of steps for setup and operation.

   In this document we describe how all of the steps in the multi-signer
   DNSSEC setup can be automated.  That is, all except the initial trust
   between involded signers.

2.2.  Secure change of name server operator

   Changing the name server operator of a DNSSEC signed zone can be
   quite a challenge.  Currently the most used algorithm is "going
   insecure".  This is a bad choice for security.  And a bad choice for
   users relying on the security of the zone.

   Changing name server operators is an edge case of multi-signer DNSSEC
   operations.  It simply comes down to the new operator joins the old
   operator in a multi-signer setup.  And once that is completed the old
   operator leaves the multi-signer setup.

3.  Algorithm

3.1.  Setting up a new multi-signer group

   The zone is already authoritatively served by one DNS operator and is
   DNSSEC signed.  For full automation both the KSK and ZSK or CSK must
   be online.

   This would be an edge case, a multi-signer group with only one
   signer.

3.2.  Configuration

   The following configrations have to be made for any signer of the
   multi-signer group before joining the group.  These steps are not
   automated by this draft.

   1.  The signers own keys (probably the keys the signer has the
       private part of)

   2.  The NS records in the zone that get update from the signer.

   3.  An established trust to the multi-signer group

3.3.  A new signer joins the multi-signer group

3.3.1.  Prerequisites

   The new signer

   1.  has a working setup of the zone, including DNSSEC signing.

   2.  uses the same algorithm for DNSSEC signing as the multi-signer
       goup uses.

3.3.2.  Steps for joining

   1.   a new signer joins the group

   2.   Exchange of keys, after this step all signers must have the
        dnskey set of all other signers of the group

   3.   Calculate CDS/CDNSKEY set

   4.   All signers put the ZSK of all other signers in their DNSKEY
        set.

   5.   All signers publish their CDS/CDNSKEY set

   6.   Wait for parent to pick up DS updates

   7.   Remove CDS/CDNSKEY set from all signers

   8.   Wait 2 time maximum TTL of DS at parent and DNSKEY at all
        children

   9.   Exchange of NS set, after this step all signers must have the ns
        set of all other signers

   10.  Compile new complete NS set with NS records from all signers

   11.  Compare to NS set at parent

   12.  If parent if different, publish CSYNC record with NS and A and
        AAAA bit set.

   13.  Wait for parent to pick up changes

   14.  Remove CSYNC record from all signers

3.4.  A signer leaves the multi-signer group

   1.   Signal to all other signers to remove the leaving signes NS
        records

   2.   Compile new complete NS set with NS records from all signers

   3.   Compare to NS set at parent

   4.   If parent if different, publish CSYNC record with NS and A and
        AAAA bit set.

   5.   Wait for parent to pick up changes

   6.   Remove CSYNC record from all signers

   7.   Wait 2 times TTL of maximum NS TTL from parent and all signers

   8.   Signal all other signers leaving of multi-signer group

   9.   Stop answering queries

   10.  Remaining signers remove ZSK of leaving signer from their DNSKEY
        set

   11.  Remaining signers recalculat DNSKEY set

   12.  Calculate CDS/CDNSKEY set

   13.  All signers put the ZSK of all other signers in their DNSKEY
        set.

   14.  All signers publish their CDS/CDNSKEY set

   15.  Wait for parent to pick up DS updates

   16.  Remove CDS/CDNSKEY set from all signers
